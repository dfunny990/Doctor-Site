			<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006q2x0" target="_blank">Doctor Who on BBC</a>
		</h3>

		<p>
			I feel it only right to mention the official television site that airs the show.  Usually they are pretty lax about who uses Doctor Who information and where they get it from, as it only increases the awareness and love of the show.
		</p>

		<h3>
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who" target="_blank">Wikipedia Doctor Who Article</a>
		</h3>

		<p>
			Naturally, the first place almost anyone goes when looking up an unfamiliar topic is Wikipedia, and this instance is no different. In this article you can find a wealth of information regarding the Doctor as well as a great many links to other articles with even more information.
		</p>

		<h3>
			<a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Doctor_Who_Wiki" target="_blank">Doctor Who Wiki Page</a>
		</h3>

		<p>
			Unlike the Wikipedia Article, this site is built and maintained solely by fans. Since it is run by fans, they keep each other in check about the facts, so they are usually very reliable. This site has some obscure information that you may not be able to find on the sites listed above.
		</p>

		<h3>
			<a href="http://www.bbcshop.com/doctor-who/icat/drwho/" target="_blank">BBC Shop</a> or
			<a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/interests/doctorwho/?itm=doctor_who_stuff&rkgid=293432632&cpg=oggk1&source=google_geek_primary&gclid=CK-Lqty3_bMCFUZgMgodDEMAGw" target="_blank">Think Geek</a>
		</h3>

		<p>
			After falling in love with the show, the next step is to get some official Doctor Who gear. These sites have the best. The first is the official BBC Doctor Who shop with all the official stuff, and the second is a different site with marvelous gear as well.
