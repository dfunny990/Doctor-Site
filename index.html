		<h3>
			A general idea of the show and this site
		</h3>
		
		<p>
			Doctor Who is a British science fiction television show about a time traveling alien and his adventures. The main character is known only as The Doctor and travels through space and time in his spaceship The TARDIS and looks for a good time (not that kind of good time). Along the way he meets fascinating people and aliens and usually saves the day. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			This page is designed for people that are 'new to who' and are looking for a bit of information before they decide to commit to the show. I have tried my best to keep the spoilers to a minimum because I would like for you to enjoy the show with all its quirks and surprises. The information on this site will simply help you keep track of who all the players are and give a bit of background information about all of them. There are many sources online that delve deeply into the Doctor Who universe, but this site is designed to be a beginnerâ€™s guide.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I would also like to point out that this site is mainly devoted to the recent revival of the show. The show has been around on and off for almost 50 years. That's quite a bit of information to try to squeeze into a page in such little time. I may update the site further down the road if the urge arises.
		</p>

		<p>
			Below is a trailer for the reboot of the show and doesn't really give anything away.
