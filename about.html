		Why I know a bit about Doctor Who
		</h3>
		
		<p>
		I have been watching the show since its latest reboot in 2005 after it had been off the air for almost ten years. I quickly came to love the show and am always anxiously awaiting the next episode. I have done significant research into this show which turns 50 next year, and while I know quite a bit, I realize that I still have quite a bit to learn. I havenâ€™t seen many of the older episodes with the first eight doctors, but I have looked into them rather extensively. Throughout the site I have put links for sites that can give more information (although probably more spoilers as well).
