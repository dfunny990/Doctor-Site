Doctor Who Website.

Made for a Writing online class, this site demonstrates my knowledge of HTML and CSS.
The site isn't really anything special, just seven pages that are rather basic.
The main part I am excited about is the navigation links in the Tardis.
I realize that functionality could have been implemented easier if I had used JavaScript, but I had not yet ventured into JavaScript upon creating this site.
I may update this site in the future to reflect what I have learned and add more features.
That bit took some figuring out but after looking around, I figured it out.

If you are a Doctor Who fan, you will notice that some of the pages are out of date, but I stopped updating the site after I turned it in.
