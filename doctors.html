		<h3>The Doctor in General</h3>
		
		<p>
		The Doctor is a species of alien known as a TimeLord. His home planet is Gallifrey. The Doctor is the last of the TimeLords because the Time War. There was a giant war and the only way to end it was to seal everyone involved way in time. Since then he has been travelling through space and time in his spaceship.
		</p>
		
		<h3>The Eleventh Doctor: Matt Smith</h3>

		</div>
		
		<p>
		Matt Smith became The Doctor after David Tennant. Many fans were disappointed because Tennant had a huge following. No one thought anyone could be as awesome as David Tennant, but it only stood to reason that Tennant couldnâ€™t be The Doctor forever. Matt Smith does a fantastic job at assuming the role of The Doctor and manages to be very silly, witty, and serious at the same time.
		</p>
		
		<h3>The Tenth Doctor: David Tennant</h3>

		</div>
		
		<p>
		David Tennant was well-loved as The Doctor. He was one of the longest serving doctors, roaming the universe for five years with various companions. His zaniness, kookiness, and general attitude toward being The Doctor made him both well liked and well respected. It is easy to see why the Doctor Who following grew so much while he was The Doctor. To this day I tell people to start with The Christmas Invasion when watching Doctor Who because it is the first episode with David Tennant and those episodes are easy to get into.
		</p>
		
		<h3>The Ninth Doctor: Christopher Eccleston</h3>

		</div>
		
		<p>
		Eccleston was the first incarnation of The Doctor in this latest reboot of the series. While being serious at times, he was also witty and kind of silly. His tenure only lasted for one season before he regenerated and became David Tennant. He only had one companion while others had multiple, and she was Rose Tyler.
